This project started with the motivation of having a telegram assistant, in which I could program processes I did 
repeatedly. Later on it turned into a fun project to share with friends and help them too.
After successfully creating a Telegram bot that could:

* Reply to basic commands
* Send images and links
* Send static, hardcoded information

I decided to add more functionality for the bot to be able to:
* Maintain conversations (or threads) of a given topic
and change the desired outcomes depending on the last bit of information. 
* Use external APIs to tailor different responses better.

All the code is hosted in Heroku for ease of use and resilience.


### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Environment running python 3.6
- Telegram account
- Heroku account

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
    ```shell script
    $ git clone https://github.com/lhandal/telegram-helper.git
    ```
2. Install required packages
    ```shell script
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a blank Telegram bot with [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)

    This step is very simple to do, just go to the link above, talk to the botfather bot and follow the stps.
    More info and detailed steps in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/shibinco/create-a-telegram-bot-using-botfather-    and-get-the-api-token-900ba00e0f39)

4. Copy the token provided by your new bot into the [credentials.py](credentials.py) script. 

5. Create a blank app in [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app)

6. Deploy the app in Heroku
    ```shell script
    $ heroku login #login
    ```
    ```shell script
    $ git init
    $ heroku git:remote -a {heroku-project-name}
    ```
    ```shell script
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Final Commit Deploying to Heroku"
    $ git push heroku master
    ```

    In my case I used GitHub CI/CD offered by heroku to redeploy the app with every commit to my repo.
    You can configure this inside the app preferences!


7. Go to the [kaffeine heroku](http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/) app and paste the name of your app in there.
If you don't know, after 30 minutes of inactivity, Heroku puts your app to _sleep_ (idle) if you are using their free tier. Most of the times that is perfectly fine, since a request or ping will wake it up. Kaffeine pings your app every 25 minutes to avoid idleness.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use this bot click on this [LINK](https://telegram.me/le_helper_bot) or simply search for **@le_helper_bot**
in Telegram and press the **/start** command. After that you can start talking with my bot.



## Features

The implemented commands are:

- `/books` - helps you find and download books online in a guided conversation
- `/doggo` - sends you a different random pic of a happy dog every time
- `/gangsta` - converts anything you send into sounding ghetto
- `/rateme` - compliments/mocks you based on the picture you send 
- `/capitalize` - converts everything you send into capital letters 
(this can be used in outside convos as well, just type **@le_helper_bot** in other groups or conversations and the option pops up!)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/lhandal/telegram-helper/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- TODOS -->
## TODOs

* Implement a NLP model to be able to hold conversations better. 
* Implement more functions to include in outside conversations.
* Increase the number of input options for more robustness.
* Add any other functionalities to automate repeated processes.
